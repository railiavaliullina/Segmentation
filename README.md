# Segmentation

## About The Project

1) Implementation of Unet architecture from `U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation` paper:

        https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf
    
2) Training implemented model for segmentation of 2 classes (background, digit) on synthetic dataset generated from CIFAR10 and MNIST datasets.
